In this course we will learn the architecture of WWW, its main protocols, representation formats and development technologies. The practical component of the course will focus on the design and implementation of Web applications. Additional topics such as Semantic Web, Social Web and Adaptive Web will help us better understand current trends of Web development.\r\n\r\nCourse material is roughly divided into 4 learning units:\r\n\r\nClient representation (Lectures 1-3),\r\n\r\nClient programming (Lectures 4-8),\r\n\r\nServer programming (Lectures 9-13),\r\n\r\nTrends of Web Development (Lectures 14-16).",
